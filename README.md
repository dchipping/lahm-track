# Reinforcement Learning Appearance History Management for Visual Multi-Object Tracking

- Tools for benchmarking and visualising tracking
- Includes mot-gallery-agent for training RL apperance management agent

PRIORITY TODO:
- Reward function tweaks
- Setup variants of experiment via branches

TODO:
- Variants:
    - Lookup Training
    - Gallery Moving Avg
    - Moving Avg

DONE, NOT ACTIVE:
- Prune least seen track in gallery

IDEAS:
- Being more discriminative with gallery agent
- Adding LookOut recovery, using agent to tune it (LookOut uses IOU only)
- More advanced encodings/gallery, distance association
- Random init of gallery
