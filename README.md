## MOT MSc Project

- Tools for benchmarking and visualising tracking
- Includes mot-gallery-agent

PRIORITY:
- Reward function tweaks
- Setup variants of experiment via branches

TODO:
- Train experiment scripts
- Random init of gallery
- Prune least seen track in gallery

IDEAS:
- Being more discriminative with gallery agent
- Adding LookOut recovery, using agent to tune it (LookOut uses IOU only)
- More advanced encodings/gallery, distance association
