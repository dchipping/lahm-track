TODO:
- Train experiment scripts
- Reward function
- Random init of gallery
- Prune least seen track in gallery

- Averaging cosine distance lookup
- Being discriminative with gallery agent
- Adding LookOut recovery, using agent to tune it (LookOut uses IOU only)
- More advanced encodings/gallery, distance association
